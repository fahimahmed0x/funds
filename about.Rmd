## About Me
My name's **Fahim Ahmed**. I'm an incoming University of Waterloo student, passionate about computer science and finance.

## About the Project
**What investments would have made you bank if you invested in them last year?** <br /> To answer this question, I took a look at a Kaggle dataset web scraped from Yahoo Finance, containing data on over a thousand Exchange Traded Funds (ETF). My project, *Investment Analysis of Exchange Traded Funds (ETF)*, analyzes which managers created the highest returning funds, what sector had the highest returns, and what level of risk resulted in the most returns.
